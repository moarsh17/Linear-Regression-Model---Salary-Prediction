# Linear-Regression-Model---Salary-Prediction
Overview
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on experience using the dataset salary.csv. The model is developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook (cnn-01.ipynb).

Dataset
File: salary.csv
Columns:
YearsExperience: Number of years of experience of an employee.
Salary: Corresponding salary of the employee.

Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Features
1) Loads and preprocesses the salary dataset.
2) Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
3) Implements a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
4) Visualizes the regression line and predictions.

Usage

1) Ensure salary.csv is present in the same directory as the notebook.
2) Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
3) The model will train and generate a regression plot for visualization.

Output

1) Displays the regression model equation.
2) Can predict salaries for given years of experience.
3) Plots training and test results for better understanding.
